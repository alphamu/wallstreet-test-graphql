# Wallstreet

## Requirements

- Node12
- NPM

## Notes

The backend uses Express, Apollo & graphQL.
the client interacts with the API using Apollo graphQL client.
There is no REST API.
Very little process is being done on the client side, as the goal is to have
pagination for large datasets, this pages sorting and filtering client side infeasible.

## Running

In order to run the project, you will have to run and backend and client side code.

```
# Backend code
cd backend
npm install && npm start

# Client side code (ReactJS)
cd client
npm install && npm start
```
